# LinkPredictionOGB

Graphs are used to model a wide variety of complex systems ranging from social networks with
billions of users, to protein-drug interactions that are vital for understanding the effects of a treatment.
Often, our knowledge about how the components of these systems are related is incomplete. For
example, a userâ€™s negligence of their social media might lead to outdated or accidental friendships;
the cost of wet lab experiments prevent biologists from exploring all combinations of protein-drug
interactions.
Given the importance of graphs in the big data era, we want to explore methods for link prediction
and how these methods are affected by varying degrees of noise. We are particularly interested in
Graph Neural Networks (GNN), but also seek to understand non-deep approaches such as matrix
completion and simple node proximity measures. In this project proposal, we summarize and critique
current approaches for link prediction, and outline our experimental procedure for how we intend to
benchmark our selected methods.

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repo onto your machine with `git clone https://github.com/hanseaston/LinkPredictionOGB.git`
2. Navigate to the directory with `cd LinkPredictionOGB`
3. Create a new conda environment `conda env create --name link-pred --file environment.yml`
    - If you find pip requirements still missing, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
    - `environment_no_build.yml` might be required instead, and the user may need to manually remove packages from the .yml file.
4. Implement your portion of the code in `models` and test your implementations in `experiments`


### Directory Structure:
